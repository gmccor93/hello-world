I was born and raised in the Northshore area of Massachusettes; went to grade school in Lynn and lived in Salem for 9 years.
Unfortunately, due to financial hardships that were only exacerbated by COVID-19, I had to move out of the Northshore and move-in with my parents who'd moved to central Florida years prior.
I have a son who is 13 years old and is my biggest inspiration, as cliche as it sounds it's 100% true.
Around this time, I found out about a program called Scratch and introduced it to him.
After some learning curves, he began creating games and applications. I was impressed and fascinated with what he was able to do and became curios about web development as a potential new career path.

Back in 2018, I had begun my career as a dental assistant. It didn't take very long for me to come to the conclusion that this career path was not going to be my life's work.
The job security and consistent hours are nice. Though, the work itself leaves me unfulfilled and feeling stuck in life.
After moving to Florida, I hesitantly returned to dental assisting post-quarantine.
My dad, who had a 30 year long career of software engineering and programming with Fidelity Investments in Boston, finally talked me into trying my hand at web development.
I wonder if he remembers when I was learning basic HTML to improve my myspace page...

In 2023, I enrolled and completed a self-paced, non-credit certificate course in Front-End Web Development offered by The College of Central Florida.
I have since been adrift, not knowing which way to proceed in this new career path.
I'm still working as a dental assistant but, I no longer see myself as just a dental assistant.

<p>
I am a junior web developer.

<p>
While I haven't been hired to work as a web developer yet, I have given myself work in order to harness my skills and show what I can accomplish.
My passion project is a website that will host a web-based radio show I began on Amp before it was shut down by Amazon.
Every step of the process has been a joy and this is what inspires me to continue coding.
